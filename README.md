## Installation

To use userscripts you need to first install a userscript manager. They come as extensions for various browsers:

- [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) - for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera
- [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) - for Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox, Opera

After you have installed a userscript manager, head over to [https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/505396](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/505396) and click on the green "Install this script" button there.
